						The initial work on B2B SaaS Kit was done by the team at Fogbender, with Yaroslav Lapin
						(<a href="https://twitter.com/jlarky" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-rose-600"
							>@JLarky</a
						> on Twitter) leading development. We underestimated the effort roughly by a factor of six!

						<p>
							While working on Fogbender - which is a customer support system for companies whose
							customers are <i>teams</i>, not individuals - we realized that quite a few startups
							end up building B2B SaaS products without team management. This means all users at a
							customer organization share a login - like dev@company.ai - which is suboptimal for
							all sorts of reasons, one of which is rendering products like Fogbender - where
							identities of users are very important - completely useless.
						</p>

						<p>
							We also realized that B2B-focused services like ours, or Doppler for secrets
							management, or PropelAuth for authentication, face significant adoption challenges
							with startups that already have something working, even if it's later discovered that
							the alternatives are probably superior. Replacement costs are high even for a
							proof-of-concept stage product, let alone one that's established and growing.
						</p>

						<p>
							Our thinking is that marketing an open-source template with a fully-built example
							might be not as soul-crushing as marketing a "user authentication service", or a
							"secrets management service", or a "customer support service". We built this toolkit
							to make it easier for day-zero B2B founders to discover B2B-focused services.

						This project is aimed at seasoned or aspiring technical or semi-technical B2B SaaS
						founders who want to spend as little time and money as possible on things that aren't
						core to their business, while steering clear of PHP.

						We thought that the only way to convince a B2B SaaS founder that a starter toolkit is
						real is to show how an actual, relatively complex app can be assembled in a matter of
						minutes. We wanted to avoid a scenario where the note-taking sample app seems to be
						working, but one must hire a full-stack developer for six months to implement billing.

						We've taken many trips down the "roll your own" road over the years, and we definitely
						appreciate the sentiment. However, we believe the B2B SaaS ecosystem has gotten to be
						mature enough where outsourcing all non-essential services to third parties is a winning
						strategy for founders without an infinite R&D budget.

							easier to rip stuff out and swap in alternatives.
