title: Replacing React
---

React is a proven and battle-tested UI library with access to a huge ecosystem of tools and libraries - thanks to React, we have tools like react-router, react-query, and many others!

However, since the B2B SaaS Kit uses Astro, it's possible to use multiple UI frameworks [at the same time](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#mixing-frameworks).

In practice, we recommend sticking to no more than a couple of frameworks, at most one per page. For example, your marketing page can be built with Svelte or SolidJS for fast load times, while your core application can be built with React for optimal development velocity.
