title: Replacing Astro (hard)
---

While it's technically possible to replace Astro with other meta-frameworks, we have no plans of offering alternatives to Astro as an option in this toolkit.

If your team is HTML-first, anti-JavaScript, take a look at the `/setup` and `/eject` pages that ship with almost no JavaScript and work with JavaScript disabled.

If your team is experienced with SPA apps like CRA or Vite, take a look at the `/survey` page - it has no SSR, no hassle with hydration, and no server bills.

If your team is experienced with SSR frameworks, Astro makes it easy to deliver modern SSR application development with client-side routing, data fetching, and more - this is what we have on the `/app` page.

If you must go with server components, Astro server components cover quite a bit of what's possible in RSCs today, and the Astro team is on track to increase support in the near future.

If you end up porting this template to another meta-framework, please let us know!
